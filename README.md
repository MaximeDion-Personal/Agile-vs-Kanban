# Agile vs Kanban

## TL;DR

Agile teams are constrained to iteration-sized chunks of work, which can delay the implementation of new ideas until the next iteration.

Kanban's flow-based process allows for continuous adjustment and limits work-in-progress, reducing the risk of wasted effort.

**Kanban can feel like an endless treadmill so you can supplement it with "Sprint Review"**

## Agile Workflow

- Agile divides work into iterations (e.g., sprints) typically lasting one or two weeks.
- Progress is tracked in terms of iterations, and work is planned at the start of each iteration.
- Agile uses measures like velocity to determine the rate of production within an iteration.
- Agile teams may face challenges if their iteration plan is wrong, potentially leading to wasted work or deferred tasks.

Backlog -> Sprint Backlog -> In progress -> Done

**Differences in Handling Changes**:
Agile teams are constrained to iteration-sized chunks of work, which can delay the implementation of new ideas until the next iteration.

**Pro**
Agile provides a regular cycle and a more structured planning approach, which can help with team morale and provide a sense of progress.

**Cons**
Planning gets in the way of progress. People too focused on deadlines and iteration, thus cutting corners and exhausting the team. Mini death march and rolling feature over next sprint. Trying to predict the future.

## Kanban workflow

- Kanban reduces the batch size of work to **single features**.
- Planning is simple: prioritize **most important features**, and team members pick the next feature from the list when available.
- Kanban is flow-based and focuses on the current state rather than predicting the future.
- Kanban's flow-based process allows for continuous adjustment and limits work-in-progress, reducing the risk of wasted effort.

Backlog -> In-Play? -> In progress -> Done

**Differences in Handling Changes**:
Kanban teams can immediately prioritize and start new ideas, as they work on one feature at a time.

**Pro** 
Kanban is more flexible, allowing for immediate reprioritization and adjustment based on current needs and progress.

**Cons**
Integrating an endless supply of feature can feel demoralizing without milestone and

### Kanban example
1 lane per programmer, only one feature at a time per lane
